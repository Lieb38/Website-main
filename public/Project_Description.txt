I intend to make a personal website. The purpose of this website will be to display a public portfolio of my creative & programming projects. The website should display images organized by medium and/or date through a clean and clear menu system with sub-directories. 
Aside from hosting a digital portfolio of my creative work, I would also like the website to be able to present the various programming projects I hope to complete during my education at Suny New Paltz and onwards.
The website should have a submission system with administrator access. That way anytime I would like to add an image or project to the site I can simply log in and upload a file.
Lastly, I want the website to link to my social media with buttons, have a contact form that links to my email, and have a brief about-me section that includes my resume. 


I hope to add more features as time goes on and I learn of new possibilities.




Thank you,
Lieb Mathieson
